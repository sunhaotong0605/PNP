# Output
In the inference process, users only need to randomly select m sequence segments from the target sample and can use the proposed method to obtain: 1) the foundation model representations, 2) the extracted engineered features, 3) the enhanced representations obtained based on the cross-attention mechanism, and 4) the predicted label from the stacked aggregation classifier.

The four output files are named `Foundation_model_representation.pkl`, `Engineered_feature.pkl`, `Enhanced_representation.pkl` and `Predicted_output.txt`
